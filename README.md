   - Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
   - Create a free account
   - Create a free cluster (M0 tier)

2. **Get Connection String**
   - In Atlas, go to Database → Connect
   - Choose "Connect your application"
   - Copy the connection string

3. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cd server
   # Create .env file
   # Add your MongoDB Atlas connection string:
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/FDP
   ```

4. **Whitelist IP Address**
   - In Atlas → Network Access
   - Add your IP address (or "Allow Access from Anywhere" for development)

📖 **Detailed setup instructions**: See [MONGODB_ATLAS_SETUP.md](./MONGODB_ATLAS_SETUP.md)
